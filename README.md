# Python Hunt
## Quick OSINT checks for IPs and Domains during triage and investigations.

---
## Apor1a's fork: This fork is designed to add additonal functionality, including modifications to store API keys in a separate .env file to avoid hardcoding credentials. New features under development include:
* Adding PDNS lookups
* Improving Shodan output
* Adding output to file capability

---

### About
This script queries APIs for various freely-available intelligence platforms
in order to gain important context and reputation data for IP addresses and/or
domains.

---

#### Platforms Used
* WHOIS
* VirusTotal
* AlienVault OTX
* Greynoise
* Robtex
* Shodan
* ipinfo.io


##### API Keys Required for:
* VirusTotal
* Greynoise
* Shodan

If you do not wish to create an account to get an API key for these platforms,
you can use the `-p` or `--platforms` argument to only enable the platforms you
want to use.  See Example Usage below for more information.

NOTE: All three of these APIs can be obtained with free accounts.


#### Installation and Requirements
This is built for Python 3.x.

Install required modules with:
```bash
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You will need to also edit the main script to include your API keys for a few
of the platforms.  Do this in the "API Key" section near the top of the code.

If you'd like to link this in your CLI $PATH, perform the following:
```bash
$ ln -s /path/to/repo/investigate.py /usr/local/bin/investigate
```
Reload your terminal (new window, log off and back on, etc) and `investigate`
should be a native command.  You can now call it by executing directly.
```bash
$ investigate
```


#### Example Usage
Python Hunt can take single IPs as command line argument with `-i` or `--ipaddress`.
```bash
$ investigate -i 95.217.163.246
```

It can also perform a lookup for domains with `-d` or `--domain` flags.
```bash
$ investigate -d apple.com
```
Finally, it can check a file for a list of IPs or Domains.
You may mix types in the file, but they must be 1 per line.
You can do this by using `-f` or `--file`.

```bash
$ investigate -f IoC_file.txt
```
Unfortunately, due to API rate limiting with some of the free APIs, you may only
look up 5 items per minute by default.
If you have paid for API keys without limits, you can ignore this.

Otherwise, you can also specify which APIs to use with the optional `-p`
or `--platforms` flag.
By default, if no platform is specified, the script will run through all
of them.

```bash
$ investigate -i 165.254.239.130 -p ipinfo
```
Or
```bash
$ investigate -f IoC_file.txt -p otx shodan
```

#### Example Output

```bash
$ investigate -i 64.95.10.243
